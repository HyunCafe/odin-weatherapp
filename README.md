# odin-weatherapp (18 weeks into my coding journey)
For my Weather App project, I aimed to further enhance my planning and implementation abilities. I began by pseudo-coding the HTML structure and then used Figma to create a visual design. To keep track of my ideas and planning, I documented my brainstorming process in a projectapproach.md file, which helped me outline the project with bullet points, different modules, and potential future features.

For the app's design, I incorporated a sleek and user-friendly interface while focusing on the mobile-first approach. Throughout the project, I practiced using JavaScript modules and applying SOLID principles to maintain clean and organized code. I also utilized libraries and APIs, such as WeatherIcons and AccuWeather, to deliver accurate and visually appealing weather information.

While working on the Weather App, I continued to expand my knowledge of web development, gaining valuable experience in areas such as API integration, responsive design, and DOM manipulation. The project showcases my progress and dedication to learning, as well as my ability to develop a functional and aesthetically pleasing weather application.

## Future Improvements
* Hamburger menu with search history: Create a hamburger menu that stores the past 5 search histories, allowing users to easily access their recent searches.
* Interactive sunrise and sunset graph: Implement an interactive graph that displays the sunrise and sunset times, providing users with useful information for planning outdoor activities.
* Animated weather icons: Replace the current weather icons with animated icons to enhance the visual appeal of the app.
* Dynamic wallpaper based on location: Update the app's background image to change based on the user's searched location, providing a more immersive experience that better reflects the city's atmosphere.
